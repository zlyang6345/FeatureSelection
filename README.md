# Feature Selection Project 

1. This research project tries to experiment with three algorithms to see whether they can select informative features.
2. Three algorithms include Efficient and Robust Feature Selection (ERFS), Multi-Label Informed Feature Selection (MIFS), and CART tree. 
3. ERFS and MIFS are implemented. MIFS algorithm is modified using quadratic method to achieve significantly faster convergence.
